As we all know, nobody would like to remember this year in the ever future because the world has witnessed an invisible life threatening zombie, so called 'SARS-COVID-19'. This bug has let my faith in science to decrease because when patients are feeling breathless,I have no any other so called 'scientific drugs'(products of biochemical science) to prescribe apart from oxygen.\n",

This is when, I came across AI, during conversations we had about our working areas. I became interested so much so that I wanted to badly know the principles of AI. After this, I took online courses on programming language, data science, machine learning courses to get an intuition about AI.\n",

As per my understanding, I think we all have the best engines in the form of mathematical models( LR,SVM,XGB,ANN...etc) but we are trying to drive the car by adding adultered fuel(i.e, problem related to data). So,my area of focus is all in data related issues and I would like to contribute/opine on these issues. "
