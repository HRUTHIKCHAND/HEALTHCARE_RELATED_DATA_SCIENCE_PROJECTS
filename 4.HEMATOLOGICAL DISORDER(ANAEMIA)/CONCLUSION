The project which we worked on here, describes an approach to classify anaemia or to find the cause of anaemia.
I decided to create this project as I found very difficult to analyse blood reports during the peak of covid pandemic as the case loads were very high and patient turnover rate was also very high. At that time, I wanted someone to analyse these reports faster and get me insights so that I could concentrate on the treatment of the case well. Literally, frontline doctors at the peak of pandemic were so busy that they were not able to put their signatures on the discharge summary of the case or the death certificates. That was the time I realized that it would be of great help if technology can assist doctors in the very way mentioned in the project.
Its not just during the pandemic, doctors especially those who are general Physicians,Surgeons,Paediatricians and others will be found overburdened with the work loads during normal days. Therefore, I want to make an impact in the field of healthcare with the above project.
As the dataset used in this project is dummy i.e, created by ourselves...we want to test the same in the real practical scenario with the genuine dataset.
As per the project, it is tree based algorithms which performed better in classifying tasks.
