This bug has let my faith in science to decrease because when patients are feeling breathless,I have no any other so called 'scientific drugs'(products of biochemical science) to prescribe apart from oxygen.\n",

As per my understanding, I think we all have the best engines in the form of mathematical models( LR,SVM,XGB,ANN...etc) but we are trying to drive the car by adding adultered fuel(i.e, problem related to data). So,my area of focus is all in data related issues and I would like to contribute/opine on these issues. "

    "The overall steps in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques can be summarized as follows: \n",
    "1) **Endothelial cell injury** is the **1st step** in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Most of the well characterized risk factors for atherosclerosis (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, advanced age, elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations) injure the endothelium, initiating a chain of events, all attributing to atherosclerosis\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Infiltration of macrophage** into the intima. Platelet adherence to damaged endothelium.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Release** of various **inflammatory mediators like cytokines and growth factors** resulting in **Hyperplasia** of smooth muscle cells\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Proliferation of SMCs & macrophage accumulates in intima\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Cholesterol** (carried by Low Density Lipoproteins ‚Äì LDL) enters into this macrophage and is nowcalled as **foam cells**. This will lead to formation of fatty streak, which is commonly found at very young age in most of us.Fatty streak is not pathology.Now HDL will come and take up the cholesterol & deliver it to the liver. LDL will later on resend cholesterol in intima from the liver & cycle continues.Normally, this cycle is well controlled, however when there are imbalance or enzymatic reactions between HDL & LDL due to various stressors, this will result in accumulation of cholesterol & further development into athermatous plaque.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Smooth muscle cells & macrophage now release various component of extracellular matrix likeproteoglycans, collagen elastin etc. Other inflammatory cytokines release by them includes metalloproteinases, thromboxane A2, PlateletDerived Growth Factors (PDGF) and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) This components result in formation of **fibrous cap** surrounding this debris (Necrotic cells alongwith foam cells, accumulates in center). This is the **primary lesion of atherosclerosis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Plaque can **rupture** and lead to vessel **thrombosis** (Necrotic core is exposed to the endothelialsurface which then serve as a nidus for the formation of thrombus) & this will lead to various clinicalpresentations depending upon the site of involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Dystrophic **calcification** and **ulceration** in plaque can occur.\n"
