    "The dataset is very helpful for the beginners who are aspiring to be a data scientist. But if we want to adapt Artificial Intelligence into the healthcare field in true sense, then it must not just predict its results based on historical dataset but it has to mean it. In the sense, it must opine its results based on the data and not just simply predict it. In this regard, as a doctor, I am not happy with the features present in the dataset because the features like \"'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin','BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome'\" which are present in the dataset are hardly used to justify a person whether he is diabetic or not. Ofcourse, don't take me bad, the features like 'Glucose','Insulin','BMI' are helpful in just predicting the diagnosis but not in a confirmative way"

    "As a doctor, I want to clearly say that prediction doesn't work in healthcare. For example, if a 26 years old person's BMI is 20 and if you ask any layman whether he is a diabetic or not, they usually respond the person to be a non-diabetic given the fact that the person is young and his BMI is \"NORMAL_FOR_AGE\". But the result may be totally wrong because these are hardly the features of choice for a doctor to say a particular case diabetic or not. So,instead of responding, I prescribe him few tests as we all know to conclude the results. And this seems to be interesting and therefore, I want to feed the AI model, the very features that we(doctors) see and train the model,test the model and then conclude the results , based on the features that the AI model selected to diagnose the case. This will make our approach a true way in predicting the result..."

Since, I am a doctor, I thought to seek Director's permission(Head of the Institution I'm working in) to use the blood reports of many patients to do a project, I stepped back not to do so because there are many policies which I thought will interfere in my way.
